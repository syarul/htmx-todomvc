[https://htmx-todomvc.vercel.app/](https://htmx-todomvc.vercel.app/) 

### What's already in place

- ~~check todo behaving according to location hash~~
- ~~update todo count base on completion~~
- ~~delete todo~~
- ~~edit todo~~
- ~~check all todos~~

### How does this compare to the full client MVC react?

Base on number of lines codes [https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react) on each files

185 + 62 + 108 + 87 + 50 + 32 (html) = 524 lines (include some comments lines)

Where as this Hypermedia solutions with HTMX + Hyperscript + Alpine + JSX (not including missing features yet)

41 (types) + 226(components) + 14 (middleware) + 97 (app) + 32(server) = 410
