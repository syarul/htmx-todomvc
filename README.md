### How does this compare to the full client MVC react?

Base on number of lines codes [https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react) on each files

185 + 62 + 108 + 87 + 50 + 32 (html) = 524 lines (include some comments lines)

Where as this Hypermedia solutions with HTMX + Hyperscript + Alpine + JSX (not including missing features yet)

39 (types) + 14 (middleware) + 206 (app) = 259

Bundled:
2 (types) + 15 (middleware) + 128 (app) = 145
